Java Machine Learning application suggesting items for sale.
Application was build with implicit feedback rather than direct ratings from the users.
Usually users leave no rating but still they matter a lot so we need to user other 
feedback information like clicks, time spent on item, buying history.
Collaborative Filtering from Spark MLib was used to implement the Recommender System.
